Welcome to my personal website.  

Currently a Senior Economist at the Pension sector of the Institut des Politiques Publiques (IPP), I am an empirical microeconomist specialising in the evaluation of public policies. I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Warwick in 2023. Before that, I was a Research Associate at JPAL Europe.

At the IPP, my main focus is on investigating the determinants of workers' end-of-career decisions and on evaluating the impact of recent pension system reforms in France.

My second interest is in studying the barriers that prevent individuals from benefiting from public policies. One strand of this research focuses on the financial constraints faced by job-seekers wishing to enrol in adult vocational training. A second explores the effectiveness and targeting properties of interventions aiming to improve the take-up of social benefits by eligible individuals.
