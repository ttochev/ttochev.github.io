Welcome to my personal website.  

I am an empirical microeconomist specialising in evaluating public policies. Currently, I am a Post-doc at the Paris School of Economics. I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Warwick.

My main interest is in the barriers preventing individuals from benefiting from public policies. One strand of my research focuses on adult vocational training and investigates ways of addressing the financial barriers preventing job-seekers from undertaking training. A second strand explores the barriers preventing eligible individuals from obtaining their social benefits. A second interest is in the labour market spillovers of local government restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic.
