Welcome to my personal website.  

Currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Paris School of Economics, I am an empirical microeconomist specialising in the evaluation of public policies. I obtained my PhD in Economics from the University of Warwick in 2023. Before that, I was a Research Associate at JPAL Europe.

My main interest is in studying the barriers that prevent individuals from benefiting from public policies. One strand of this research focuses on the financial constraints faced by job-seekers wishing to enrol in adult vocational training. A second explores the effectiveness and targeting properties of interventions aiming to improve the take-up of social benefits by eligible individuals.

I am also interested in the labour market spillovers of local government restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic.

You can find my research [here](/research/), and my CV [here](/files/Todor_Tochev_CV.pdf).
